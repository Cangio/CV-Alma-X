    "Before the rover can autonomously manipulate the panel with its arm, it should locate and reach the panel structure itself in the Marsyard area; this code provide a way for the vision system to tell the panel's body from the terrain, discriminating color and shape, and reconstruct it's position while choosing the best way to approach it. It operates in this way:\n",

    "1.**contours individuation**\n",
    "The terrain has a reddish tone, while the panel itself will be white or shiny metal; a color mask it's applied to segment the current view (assumption: panel itself it's already contained in the current view) and the result will be used to extract contours\n",

    "**var**: search for contours in both unmodified and masked image, then try to match contours present in both\n",
    "\n",
    "2.**candidate contours selection**\n",
    "Only contours composed by 4 elements (edges) are considered; to reject the errors, a test on the area enclosed by the lines is performed: the ratio between biggest one found (by testing all) and the tested one, should not be too small (value calculated with respect too surfaces' dimension of the panel). Since the camera is, in reality, able to view up to 3 sides of the panel (box shaped), only the 3 biggest candidates that fullfill previous condition are selected.\n",
