2a)
extrinsic, intrinsic parameters, camera calibration
ppm, homography
image warping, distorsion compensation

2)
camera orientation from vanishing points

3) intensity transformations
linear stretching operator
exponential operator (for over/under-exposed)
histogram equalization (enhancement)
+ local histograms/ hist.matching

4a) spatial filtering
low pass filters:
mean filter (linear,fastest)
gaussian f. (linear)
median f. (non lin., sharper edges)
bilinear (non lin.)
non local mean f. (non lin., best)

4) fourier transformation filtering
rotation compensation for images with periodic pattern

5) image segmentation
denoising (separation of hist. peaks)
automatic thresholding:
peaks method (lowest valley between peaks)
otsu's (min in-group spreading)
adaptive th.:
hysteresis th. 
colour based segmentation:
malanobhis distance

6) motion detection
3 frames difference
background subtraction/initialization/updating

7)binary morphology
opening (er->dil) with specific kernel to preserve elements
closing (dil->er)

8) blob analysis
compactness(form factor)
(hu's) moments (shape recognition)
covariance matrix (orientation: principal axis of inertia)
eigenvalues (size)

9)edge detection
canny's
differences between original image and dilation

10)local inveriant features
harris corner detector
sift
surf (blob like features)
mser (uniform regions, darker/lighter than surroundings)
fast (corner like features)
brief, orb,brisk (faster)
+best bin first search

11)object detection
shape based matching (edges only from training image)
(generalized) hough transform (shape recognition)

12)3d cv
lidar
multiple viewpoints, disparity map
box filtering
